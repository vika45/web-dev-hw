1. For heading and body, there is only one of each. The head is special because it is considered to contain the thought of the actual page, since its the first thing in the root. The body is what contains the actual data that is within the browser and then displayed on the computer.
2. Structural markup contains information about the structure of the document. This includes headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup serves to reinforce the semantics/meaning of the content in the document. They can be used to place emphasis on a word or phrase, or to identify a word as strong.
3. My work cycle for this assignment was similar to the last assignments. I always read through the class website first, and then I complete the assignment while watching the walk through, because other wise I don't think I would be able to understand what I was doing. I then complete the assignment and write my response and then turn it all in.
