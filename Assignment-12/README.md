1. My imaginary client was a used sporting goods store that wanted a cool, clean, and masculine look.
2. The display:inline; rule makes so that all elements act like inline elements which ignores width properties, does not force new lines, cannot change vertical space between themselves and elements. The display: inline-block rule also removes new lines inherent within block element. However, it also enforces elements to listen to margin and vertical spacing properties or rules. The display: block element can turn elements into block elements, which are commonly used to create vertical bars.
3. For this assignment I did not watch any of the walkthroughs I just tried to go solely off what I could do from the directions given. It took me a lot longer which is why it is being turned in later, but I also think I did a much better job as far as understanding what I was doing.
