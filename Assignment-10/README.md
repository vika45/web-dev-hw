1. System Fonts are already instilled within each local device. They are usually available to most programs, but usually is not available for the web. Web fonts, on the other hand, are customized on a specific server. They require certain elements to use, but they do not have to be available on the users device to appear. There are also web safe fonts that developers count on being available by any system. This includes font families that should be available on both Mac and Windows.
2. Font Fallbacks or stacks are crucial. They serve as a cushion for if a browser fails to find the primary choice. It is important to choose a similar fonts when choosing a primary and fallback font, in the case that the browser is slow to load a primary choice and first loads the fallback then the primary.
3. My work cycle for this assignment was pretty standard, the only part I struggled with was understanding why we have a folder for fonts but I did not have anything in those files?
