1. A div element offers a block-level element to group elements together. The class attribute allows for grouping of similar types of elements together, this makes styling much easier. The id attribute, also known as the global identifier, it helps identify labels that are specific to an element. Spans fall within the div element, it allows identification of text that needs to appear visually unique on the rendered html page.
2. The alt attribute is used to specify alternative text that is to be rendered when the element it is applied to doesn't fit.
3. This assignment was fairly easy until it got time to put in our own video not a link from youtube, I have absolutely no idea what we are supposed to do for that since we do not have a file with an mp4 video on it. I just copied all of your coding for practice but was not sure what else I was supposed to do.
