# Assignment-02
## David Faatuiese

I decided to take this class because I know basically nothing about web design or computers in general, so I wanted to challenge myself in my last semester.

Things I have learned/ hope to learned:

1. Basic level of coding
2. Best ways to design a web page
3. What role web design has in our everyday lives
