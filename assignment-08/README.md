1. To be honest, I feel as though almost everything we go over in this class is completely new to me. I am learning a lot and I am also finding a lot of joy in making these websites and coding, which I have to admit as very shocking. Overall, the walkthroughs really help but I am nervous that I wont remember everything we have learned to make an actual website if I don't have a walkthrough.
2. I am excited to learn more about just how complicated the styling can get and how unique each website can look using relatively the same algorithm to get there.
3. For this I did what I normally do, which is reading through the lesson first and then watching the walkthrough while doing the actual coding. I am concerned, however, because nothing has been graded yet and I am worried that you cannot see my work.
