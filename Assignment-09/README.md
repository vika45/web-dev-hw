1. Universal Selectors  are used to style every element on that page, it is a star. Element Selectors are used to select all elements of a certain type. Class Selectors are used when selecting elements that serve the same function. ID selectors, much like class selector, allows you to define rules for styling for a specific element using is unique ID, they use a number sign.
2. The main colors I chose for this were white, orange, a darker blue(#3FB0AC), and a lighter blue/teal (#173E4E).
3. This was most definitely the hardest assignment for me so far. I think the style page was just new to me and so I struggled to grasp the format of it. I usually can get the majority of what I need from the walk through so this was a lot harder, but I also think it made me learn more. I really appreciate your help when I email at the last moment.
